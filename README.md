# Movies-ETL

In this module, we learned how to use the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to create data pipelines. A data pipeline moves data from a source to a destination, and the ETL process creates data pipelines that also transform the data along the way. Analysis is impossible without access to good data, so creating data pipelines is often the first step before any analysis can be performed. Therefore, understanding ETL is an essential skill for data analysis.
